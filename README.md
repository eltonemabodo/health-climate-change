# health-climate-change

The project seeks to investgate the relationship between climate conditions variables (temperature and precipitation) and the health outcomes of children under the age of five in Zimbabwe. The study uses four waves of the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health
Survey (ZDHS) and using weight-for-age, and hieght-for-age z scores to measure the nutritional outcomes. Although precipitation and temperature are key explanatory variables, other control measures such as socioeconomic demographic characteristics are also included.
The files are arranged as follows:

- `code/` - all the code used for cleaning and analysis of the data.
- `processed data/` - only cleaned and processed data is tracked, to comply with the ethical requirements of the DHS program.
